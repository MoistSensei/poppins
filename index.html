        <p class="body-text" id= "INTRO"> <b>Poppins</b> is a San Serif Typeface created by <b>Johnny Pinhorn</b>, an English Type designer that currently works under the Indian Type Foundry. Jonny Pinhorn graduated from Birmingham Institute of Art & Design in 2008 with a 1st Class B.A. (Hons) degree in Visual communication.
        That same year he was accepted onto the highly regarded post-graduate M.A. in type design at the University of Reading where he graduated in 2009. Throughout this time, and continuing on into his professional life, Jonny has developed and indulged his broad interests in type design and particularly that of Non-Latin types. 
        He now designs Indian typefaces full-time here at ITF, and so far has worked on Tamil, Gujarati and Malayalam scripts. In his spare time Jonny enjoys the often weird and exotic lifestyle that comes with being a foreigner living in India. ITF is a digital type foundry, designing and distributing fine-quality fonts for Indian and Latin scripts. They have designed fonts for some of the world's 
        most iconic brands, including Apple, Google, Samsung and Sony.  Our retail library offers fonts for text and display use, in visual styles ranging from traditional to experimental.
